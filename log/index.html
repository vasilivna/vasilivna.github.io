<h1>Signals, Plants, and Labor Camps</h1>

<p>Picking the next topic is existential problems and I was lost for weeks (?) and almost wrote about Georgi Markov. Almost ;).</p>
<p>I was furiously pedalling on a spin bike and going nowhere the other day when the podcast I was listening to stopped being about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osip_Mandelstam">Osip Mandelstam</a>'s death anniversary (December 27th, 1938) and started being about plants that "shouldn't be there".</p>
<p>One of RFE/RL&rsquo;s cultural digests--&ldquo;Time of Freedom&rdquo; by Andrey Sharogradsky, reported about an exhibition that <a href="http://zasushennye.ru/">recently opened at the Moscow Museum of Architecture,&ldquo;Засушенному -- верить&rdquo;</a> which I can only translate as &ldquo;What&rsquo;s dried out can be believed&rdquo;. Unfortunately, as a Ukrainian I&rsquo;m well advised to avoid travel to Russia and won&rsquo;t be able to speak to the contents of the fascinating materials presented there, but, to summarize their general nature, the exhibition traces the history of Stalinist repressions through herbariums collected at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solovki_prison_camp">Solovki prison camps</a>--some of these collected by the prisoners themselves--supplemented by archival materials (letters, official documents).</p>
<p>The wellspring of this project seems to be Moscow University botanist Vladimir Vekhov who, in the 1960s, founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sea_Biological_Station#The_botanical_garden">a botanical garden</a> on the Kindo peninsula near Belomorsk (on the mainland near the Solovetsky Islands) and also discovered six plants that were rather out of place within the native boggy taiga vegetation--among them the wild pea <em>Lathyrus gmelinii, </em>endemic to central Asia, southern Siberia, and southern and central Ural, and the five-leaved white lupine clover <em>Lupinaster albus </em>which was known to grow in northern Asia and North America, and was never previously found in northern Europe.</p>
<p>Introduced plants are nothing new, but none of these species were found anywhere near current human settlements in the region, or even railways serving them, where they would have been in the company of many other introduced plants, mostly &ldquo;weeds&rdquo;, which often arrive surreptitiously via shoe soles, airstreams, and bird droppings. Moreover, none were the type of invasive species that could even be classified as weeds (which further piques curiosity as to how and why they found a life there).</p>
<p>Upon questioning the locals, the botanists learned that in the 1930s and 40s the half-ruined barracks near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sea_Biological_Station">White Sea Biological Station</a> from which they were conducting their field experiments belonged to forced labor camp prisoners logging wood in the surrounding forests.</p>
<p><a href="http://zasushennye.ru/himija-i-zhizn/">Biologist D.D. Sokolov picked up the threads of this story</a> in the late nineties. When he arrived on the scene 40 years later he was not only able to find and add several new species to Vekhov&rsquo;s special group of exotics (<em>Calamagrostis obtusata</em>, <em>Stellaria holostea</em>)--he also discovered the same exotic species group near labor camp barrack ruins of the same period on a neighboring island, and determined that we could reasonably expect to find all these species growing together in a meadow in southern Ural. Sokolov's guess is that these plants were seeded from hay, prepared in the East and shipped to the area during the period of Stalinist repressions.</p>
<p>Weeds and &ldquo;alien&rdquo; plants are fucking awesome and were my gateway drug to the present obsession with ecological underdogs (trash monsters, bed bugs, flies, pigeons) and their lifeways. I've jokingly thought of myself as a spoiled disciple of Timothy Morton's <em>Dark Ecology/Ecology without Nature</em>... Since that's what I'll be having but with all the nature. Anyways.</p>
<p>In actuality I was the disciple/child, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengiz_Gudava">Tengis Gudava</a>--a repressed Soviet dissident, who spent 5 years in labor camps in Perm, and would have spent more but was pardoned. As one might not imagine, a life with the remains of someone who was broken and tortured in labor camps is a special sort of not nice, though those remains did do some fun stuff in the meantime like write a <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2302908/">fiction novel about a hermaphroditic angel in a gulag</a> that is apparently popular with the gay community and a <a href="https://www.netslova.ru/gudava/sumer/">really intense manuscript about Sumerians and the Bible</a> that isn't popular with anyone.</p>
<p>I've read none of it, not least of all because reading my stepfather's work is not just personally unpleasant but often deals with intense trauma as its subject and not with weeds or pigeons. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll think about how I could cut, reframe, repurpose, and appropriate some of the things he wrote so that maybe something new comes out of the pieces. Like how the <em>Myennis octopunctata</em> fly came to be on the pieces of maple KyivZelenBud left behind.</p>
<p>
<p>Meanwhile, I've been working on a sound album, featuring one fabulous Ukrainian lady (identity to be revealed), to bring to life the generated KyivZelenBud poems I gave a peek of in my first post. Ultimately I am aiming for an album of field recordings, minimally manipulated, highlighting all the participants of the mistletoe-Myennis chain. Playing around with those sounds during the short days and long nights of this endless gray winter, here's something noisier I inadvertently created, as one is wont to do when trying to make something nice. <br /><br /></p>

<h1>Urban Ecology Chains Are Magic</h1>

<p class="permalink"><a href="#2018-12-15-01">December 15, 2018</a></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/50042669-c1d6e780-006e-11e9-81db-5dd9d912d662.png" alt="KZB_chain" width="600" height="550" /></p>
<p>Reasonable panic has been brewing in Kyiv--maples, poplars, oaks, and other popular urban tree varieties are being indiscriminately mauled by the city&rsquo;s municipal landscaping organization &ldquo;<a href="http://kievzelenbud.com">KyivZelenBud</a>&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll leave that story alone, as I trust it&rsquo;s receiving its share of attention, and instead tell another--a multispecies muddle (to use Donna Haraway&rsquo;s phrase)--one that&rsquo;ll fit some birds, a shrub, a tree, a KyivZelenBud (KZB) worker&rsquo;s chainsaw, and a fly (among other insects). Just in time for the holidays, here&rsquo;s the magical-but-very-real urban ecology story you&rsquo;ve been waiting for!</p>
<p><br />As its name suggests, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistle_thrush">mistle thrush</a> likes mistletoe, and its sticky berries, though they contain a toxin called viscumin, which gives it the shits. This, for the mistletoe, is the entire point, as, relieving itself while still &ldquo;at the table&rdquo;, so to speak, the thrush &ldquo;plants&rdquo; the seed pod onto a nearby branch to spread.</p>
<p>We, the citizens, hate mistletoe. Long gone are the days when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_of_oak_and_mistletoe">we donned white gowns to cut it with a ritual golden sickle</a> and stirred it into magical elixirs. The mistletoe is a parasite. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscum_album">evergreen hemiparasite</a>, which can produce almost all its food on its own, even in the winter, feeding birds and insects while its host stands bare... but a parasite nonetheless! An opportunist.</p>
<p>And so, according to KZB protocol, city trees must be free of mistletoe.</p>
<p>Years ago, when a maple tree on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/maUfaGZJpv72">1/6 Zakhidna street</a> was pruned by KZB workers to remove its mistletoe, the wounds invited some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomes_fomentarius"><em>Fomes fomentarius</em></a> spores inside. First a parasite, then a decomposer, <em>Fomes</em> is a harbinger of death, finding weak trees and making them weaker, for decades sometimes, until their insides are rotten and ready to take on new, simpler forms (amino acids, compost).</p>
<p>I could end the story there, but here&rsquo;s how this one keeps going.</p>
<p>During the spring and fall, <em>Fomes fomentarius</em> (the tinder conk, the hoof fungus, the blood sponge, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi">Iceman&rsquo;s mushroom</a>) releases 887 million spores per second. The spores are so small, they look like smoke.</p>
<p><br />On the night of August 8th, I was taking a walk past the maple on 1/6 Zakhidna street, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D5ef8b1EG27KBKJC8">under the lamplight it seemed the mushrooms were burning. I looked closer, and found a squirming, thriving, vibrant insect community</a>!</p>
<p>The colonies changed in composition--crawling worms and moths at night, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D23tTNb9APt7iqoLLJuhes4_44ig2bVf?usp=sharing">orange, red, and brown flies in the daytime</a>, all insects I couldn&rsquo;t identify. Among them was... another insect I couldn&rsquo;t identify, but which to me was markedly different from the rest--<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bc2Z_kGrPDorDAkD223Tk1Qt3BQliS_6">a beautiful, tiny, shiny, zebra-striped fly</a>.</p>
<p>The insect community was elating enough in itself, but the fly became an obsession.</p>
<p>At first I entertained the wild notion that the Australian <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jean_hort/5750004212/"><em>Lenophila nila </em></a>had migrated to Ukraine, but my conscience wouldn&rsquo;t let me enjoy this outlandish LIE. Three months later, with Medvedev&rsquo;s <em>Keys to the Insects of the European Part of the USSR</em>, and hundreds of diptera.info pages behind me, I made a definitive classification -- <a href="http://ukrbin.com/index.php?id=55824"><em>Myennis octopunctata</em></a>, a picture-wing fly! As flies eat both mushrooms and nectar, I am still unsure about what attracted them to the mushroom--the fungus itself, or the syrup that was oozing out of its top.</p>
<p>Cathartic identifications aside (and believe me this is not the last you&rsquo;ll hear about flies from me)--how humbling! This unexpected, promiscuous, and unruly intrusion. These cavorting fungi and birds and flies and beetles, all continuing on, when we&rsquo;d rather be solemn, and mourn our thwarted desires for maples! To join in the merriment, I&rsquo;d like to naively celebrate KyivZelenBud as the poetic agent of this holiday story, with a few, robot-crafted poems--sourced from the posts on their website, and fed through a Markov chain.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Thank you for your attention if you made it all the way here! As Anna Tsing put it, &ldquo;if a rush of troubled stories is the best way to tell contaminated diversity, then it&rsquo;s time to make that rush part of our knowledge practices&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m still learning about all the actors in this story, and I think there&rsquo;s lots more to come. If you&rsquo;re interested in hearing more about the blood sponge, seeing pictures of fly genitalia, or sharing your own nature stories, please join my new club &ldquo;ZHYKU&rdquo;. Its name stands for ZHYviy KUtochok, which literally means &ldquo;living corner&rdquo;. And if you&rsquo;re based in Ukraine, stay tuned for in-person club events this spring.</p>
<p>ZHYKU lives on <br /><br /></p>
