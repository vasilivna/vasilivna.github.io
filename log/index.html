<h1>Urban Ecology Chains Are Magic</h1>

<p>Reasonable panic has been brewing in Kyiv--maples, poplars, oaks, and other popular urban tree varieties are being indiscriminately mauled by the city&rsquo;s municipal landscaping organization &ldquo;<a href="http://kievzelenbud.com">KyivZelenBud</a>&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll leave that story alone, as I trust it&rsquo;s receiving its share of attention, and instead tell another--a multispecies story (to use Donna Haraway&rsquo;s phrase)--one that&rsquo;ll fit some birds, a shrub, a tree, a KyivZelenBud (KZB) worker&rsquo;s chainsaw, and a fly (among other insects). Just in time for the holidays, here&rsquo;s the magical-but-very-real urban ecology story you&rsquo;ve been waiting for!</p>
<p><br />As its name suggests, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistle_thrush">mistle thrush</a> likes mistletoe, and its sticky berries, though they contain a toxin called viscumin, which gives it the shits. This, for the mistletoe, is the entire point, as, relieving itself while still &ldquo;at the table&rdquo;, so to speak, the thrush &ldquo;plants&rdquo; the seed pod onto a nearby branch to spread.</p>
<p>We, the citizens, hate mistletoe. Long gone are the days when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_of_oak_and_mistletoe">we donned white gowns to cut it with a ritual golden sickle</a> and stirred it into magical elixirs. The mistletoe is a parasite. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscum_album">evergreen hemiparasite</a>, which can produce almost all its food on its own, even in the winter, feeding birds and insects while its host stands bare... but a parasite nonetheless! An opportunist.</p>
<p>And so, according to KZB protocol, city trees must be free of mistletoe.</p>
<p>Years ago, when a maple tree on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/maUfaGZJpv72">1/6 Zakhidna street</a> was pruned by KZB workers to remove its mistletoe, the wounds invited some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomes_fomentarius"><em>Fomes fomentarius</em></a> spores inside. First a parasite, then a decomposer, <em>Fomes</em> is a harbinger of death, finding weak trees and making them weaker, for decades sometimes, until their insides are rotten and ready to take on new, simpler forms (amino acids, compost).</p>
<p>I could end the story there, but here&rsquo;s how this one keeps going.</p>
<p>During the spring and fall, <em>Fomes fomentarius</em> (the tinder conk, the hoof fungus, the blood sponge, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi">Iceman&rsquo;s mushroom</a>) releases 887 million spores per second. The spores are so small, they look like smoke.</p>
<p><br />On the night of August 8th, I was taking a walk past the maple on 1/6 Zakhidna street, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D5ef8b1EG27KBKJC8">under the lamplight it seemed the mushrooms were burning. I looked closer, and found a squirming, thriving, vibrant insect community</a>!</p>
<p>The colonies changed in composition--crawling worms and moths at night, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D23tTNb9APt7iqoLLJuhes4_44ig2bVf?usp=sharing">orange, red, and brown flies in the daytime</a>, all insects I couldn&rsquo;t identify. Among them was... another insect I couldn&rsquo;t identify, but which to me was markedly different from the rest--<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bc2Z_kGrPDorDAkD223Tk1Qt3BQliS_6">a beautiful, tiny, shiny, zebra-striped fly</a>.</p>
<p>The insect community was elating enough in itself, but the fly became an obsession.</p>
<p>At first I entertained the wild notion that the Australian <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jean_hort/5750004212/"><em>Lenophila nila </em></a>had migrated to Ukraine, but my conscience wouldn&rsquo;t let me enjoy this outlandish LIE. Three months later, with Medvedev&rsquo;s <em>Keys to the Insects of the European Part of the USSR</em>, and hundreds of diptera.info pages behind me, I made a definitive classification -- <a href="http://ukrbin.com/index.php?id=55824"><em>Myennis octopunctata</em></a>, a picture-wing fly! As flies eat both mushrooms and nectar, I am still unsure about what attracted them to the mushroom--the fungus itself, or the syrup that was oozing out of its top.</p>
<p>Cathartic identifications aside (and believe me this is not the last you&rsquo;ll hear about flies from me)--how humbling! This unexpected, promiscuous, and unruly intrusion. These cavorting fungi and birds and flies and beetles, all continuing on, when we&rsquo;d rather be solemn, and mourn our thwarted desires for maples! To join in the merriment, I&rsquo;d like to naively celebrate KyivZelenBud as the poetic agent of this holiday story, with a few, robot-crafted poems--sourced from the posts on their website, and fed through a Markov chain.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Thank you for your attention if you made it all the way here! As Anna Tsing put it, &ldquo;if a rush of troubled stories is the best way to tell contaminated diversity, then it&rsquo;s time to make that rush part of our knowledge practices&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m still learning about all the actors in this story, and I think there&rsquo;s lots more to come. If you&rsquo;re interested in hearing more about the blood sponge, seeing pictures of fly genitalia, or sharing your own nature stories, please join my new club &ldquo;ZHYKU&rdquo;. Its name stands for ZHYviy KUtochok, which literally means &ldquo;living corner&rdquo;. And if you&rsquo;re based in Ukraine, stay tuned for in-person club events this spring.</p>
<p>ZHYKU lives on <br /><br /></p>
