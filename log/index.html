<p>On a Tour of DWRF</p><hr/>
<p><i>The straight-traveled road is filled with fallen wood,
<p>The road is filled and is overgrown with grass, 
<p>Along that straight-traveled road
<p>No one has passed on foot,
<p>No one has ridden past on a good steed.
<hr/>
<p>By that Swamp, by that Black Swamp,
<p>By that birch, by that crooked birch,
<p>By that stream, by Smorodina,
<p>By that cross, by that cross of Lebanon

<p>Sits Nightingale the Robber, Odikhmanty's son.

<hr/>
<p>At first he was just a man, grey-haired and slight, who appeared seemingly out of nowhere and insisted on going first, though he clearly wasn't a fast walker. I thought he was trying to teach us how to truly enjoy the outdoors. Well, I thought, I can, and I touched the wet lichen on the pine and I pointed at the yarrow and whispered, yarrow! 

<p>Our tour group met close to the river fork, where the northern and southern arms of the Darnitsya river split, just inside the Brovary pine forest. Not far from here, I had seen birches lie down as if pushed about by a giant hand.

<p>A tornado did it, says one man. 10 meters across. A band passed, “vzzhhhhuh,” and straight fell them all. 

<p>Our guide says that here, at the river fork, the legendary Nightingale the Robber had operated.
<hr/>
<p><i>Nightingale whistles like a nightingale,
<p>He screams, the villain robber, like a wild animal, 
<p>And from the whistle of a nightingale, 
<p>And from the scream of a wild animal
<p>All the grasses and meadows become entangled, 
<p>All the azure flowers lose their petals,
<p>All the dark woods bend down to the earth,
<p>And all the people there lie dead.
<hr/>
<p>The older man was with a younger woman. They both wore rain ponchos. She walked behind him, and they would on occasion point things out to one another, and to everybody generally. They looked more satisfied than we did and nodded with confidence at the ferns, the wet mounds of clay, the rope swing by the lake. With time, it became clear that the man had seen these pines when he was young, when the pines were young, and watched the locals put up fences around their houses using old, green, wooden boards they removed from train wagons. The people had started to steal them. In the center of town, just outside the forest, there was a satirical board on which a resident caricaturist softly shamed wagon-repair workers who drank too much or were involved in petty crimes. Regarding the old train wagon boards, it was promptly decreed they could be bought or distributed (the satirical board only had so much space). 
<hr/>
<p>///
<p>A Brief Historical Interlude
<hr/>
<p>The pines meanwhile had been planted by Stalin, not personally, during a greening effort in the 50s, after a razing effort in the 30s. And, during that same time, there was another green-board fence, not too far off, behind the pines, known as The Green Fence, where, after another razing effort, Stalin planted whoever was undesirable, some 50,000 to 100,000 people in the ground, we do not know for sure. These are such things as the weather, as nitrogen cycles, as the wind. Could you calculate where the wind blows each second? No. So it is with bodies. They slip through the cracks. Some confuse and confound. 

<p>Today it’s 38 years since the death of M. Khvylovy. I decided to spend this day here, alone, among the blooming trees and the birds. To hear only their truthful language. Not long ago, in Darnitsya, by the graves in the forest where the fascists shot thousands of our prisoners, some shepherds found another grave with hundreds of bodies. The newspaper printed a notice about yet another evil committed by the occupying army. Meanwhile, the forensic team established that the bodies are from… 1937! Nobody had known about them till now. So, whose prisoners were they?

<p> Back to the Tour of DWRF 
<hr/>
<p>  At break times, as a young boy, the man swam in this lake naked because it was a school day and nobody had spare clothes. It had been called Bull Swamp. This is either because the bulls pulled someone out of the swamp, or because the bulls had to be pulled out of the swamp—the nuances of the situation have been lost. When the wagon-repair workers began to live here, they drained the swamp, expanded it, and the swamp became a lake called “Little Birch”. Summer camp was right here too. It was called "Little Pine”.

 

<p><i>The whole railroad was up in that camp. This whole town is vedomstvenniy [industry-sponsored, distributed to workers based on merit]. Cut off from the whole world. It is rare for a DWRF⁠er to leave this silence. You can walk down the road and not see a single car.  </i>

<p><i>Did your whole family work at the wagon-repair factory? 

<p><i>Of course, everyone's did. The factory still works. Used to work in four shifts. Now it works half of one. The only one still in operation. We’ve got a museum. And over there they’d find bombs and detonate them. Day and night the whistle of breaks.  </i>

<p>I don't know when the change began, but by the time we had seen the dilapidated pre-war luxury apartments, of which only a titanic carcass, with eye holes gaping into the sky, was left; and seen the packs of homeless dogs, which scared us, but were either ignored or deftly deflected by local children with a twisting swish of a stick; and seen the Darnitsky Wagon-Repair Factory itself; and seen the pedestal, out front, where Lenin once stood (they only put him near important enterprises); by the time we had seen all this, the man had grown sour, surly, and quarrelsome.

<p>The tram, he was sure, never went as far as was implied. 

<p><i>This was a pre-war tram, though! 

<p>Still. </i>

<p>By the water tower, the angle at which it was indicated another water tower was located threw him into a rage. He and the guide engaged in a disjointed debate, drawing closer, closer, then suddenly splitting apart like magnets. Their words to one another flew out from behind corners, darted between spurred, jerky silences; nobody could tell whether a conversation was really going on. The sounds of the man’s grumbles and shouts were carried every which way by the wind. The group had spread out and was moving on to something better. The guide walked quickly ahead, leading the way, and some of those left in close proximity to the man chuckled good-naturedly. 

<p> <i> We are penperdicular to the road. Penperdicular. Penperdicular!</i>

<p>The man didn't seem to have any will left not to say it. 

<p><i>Penperdicular.</i>

<p>We stopped inside a residential building, front door ajar, and piled in on the first floor landing. Soviet-era signs still hаng on the walls: 

<p><i>Citizens, remember, 3 to 6 m^3 of water will leak, per day, out of a broken toilet tank. Perform timely repairs on your toilet tank. 

<p>Tenant comrades! Keep your section clean and tidy. </i>(Here, someone had edited section to read pussy.) 

<p><i>This house has been released to the tenants for socialistic safekeeping.​</i>

<p>He'd never seen such rubbish in his life. Not the signs. But to look at them! 

<p><i>Daddy, please calm down.</i>

<p>Things kept escaping, they were boiling over and out of him, and there wasn't much he could really do about it, it seemed. In the distance, the moan of train brakes scraped by at short intervals.

<p><i>OK, dad, we're walking home.</i> 

<p><i>It's far from here. </i> 

<p><i>It's fine.</i> 

<p>Then they crossed the tram tracks and were gone. 

<p>The guide was rather matter-of-fact about the man: <i>It’s always a story when the locals show up. They always think they know better.</i>

<p>Vasyl Hlushko
<hr/>
<p>Vasyl Hlushko grew up in a regular country family and is now retired. His mother had problems with her heart and when she fired up the stove she often lost consciousness. His father drank. In 1968 Vasyl was 15 and began working at the botanical garden. He cared for a sea of Dutch tulips and giant carpets of red and yellow roses. After this, he was a wagon-repair worker for 44 years. He was a carpenter, a master, a foreman. He fixed the breaks. He was, thank god, always good with his hands. Vasyl Ivanovich has been awarded two awards. The first award is the “Honorable Worker of Ukrainian Transport” award. The second award is for “Significant Personal Contribution to the Development of Railway Transport, Many Years of Hard Work, and High Professionalism”. Vasyl believes that flowers are able to transfer thoughts and feelings, especially when one cannot find these during an important moment. He keeps 500 tulips and 50 rose bushes. When the garden is asleep, Vasyl paints. For example, he has painted Albrecht Durer and Taras Shevchenko. Vasyl never wrote poetry, but then he had a heart attack and began writing some. He writes about the Ukrainian people, about their hangmen, about his hometown, and about his mother.

<p>Elena Galas<hr/>
<p>Elena Galas is a blacksmith at DWRF, the Darnitsky Wagon-Repair Factory. She works in line with one hundred men. She is a punch-press operator. She is not a secretary, and she is not an accountant. 
 
<p>The men are taming metal and fire. Elena Galas is wearing an apron. She removes hot parts from a gas furnace and stamps them under a press. She is an udarnitsa — an enthusiastic superproductive laborer — of heavy male labor. Old complexes are replaced with new lofts, but the most beautiful roses are still on the Boulevard of Labor. Elena Nikolaevna started ten years ago. First she was in the foundry, and then she was in the forge. Her uncle and sister also work here. 
 
<p>The factory arranged Elena’s professional and personal life. Elena met Vitaly in the foundry, and now there is Zhenya, who will go to school next year. They live in a shared dormitory. Elena’s team is wonderful and friendly. The men do not offend Elena. They don’t complain about her work, even though she does it with her female hands and not with male force. At first it was hard for Elena to get used to the heat and the noise, but then she got “sucked into it”. She is not a grumpy woman, thank god. She does not quarrel. With special reverence, on March 8th, Elena’s colleagues congratulate her that she is a woman. This pleases her. But it is not only on this happy women’s holiday that the men do not forget she is a woman, they do not forget it throughout the year. They treat Elena like the most fragile part of the machine. 
 
<p>Elena Galas gets carried away when she speaks of devices; she speaks of things we cannot later recall. We look them up on Wikipedia and make believe these are the things she spoke of: mallets and flatters, fullers, swages, mandrels… The female blacksmith explains things to us we do not understand, so we go to her home in the hostel to photograph her in a familiar environment. We cannot believe Elena was wearing gray overalls before. What a hostess she is — everywhere we feel the female hand. Lena likes to plant flowers in flowerpots. Lena cooks different goodies in the kitchen. 
 
<p>It is nice when a person is happy with her family and work. But it is especially gratifying that in our time, even performing purely male work, a woman feels confident. So this is how our fragile women can be!

<p>///<hr/>
<p>The river Darnitsya <hr/>
 

<p> The source of the river Darnitsya lies in the village of Knyazhichi (pop. 5207), between an 80,000-square-meter horse club, which is under full (indoor and outdoor!) video surveillance, and which, besides, has enough oats and hay for a 12-month period; a lake with a sign that reads Swimming is forbidden–the water does not correspond to sanitary norms; and a small grocery shop called Hope. 

<p> Darnitsya comes out of the earth, flows under a street named Laguna, and immediately becomes known as source and stream Plyakhoviy. If the villagers reproached the stream for thwarting their desires to dig root cellars, they probably did not show it. Its water, abundant and clear, was a gift. 

<p> Plyakhoviy, the bottle stream, the one to which to carry a vessel, flows to the west, towards Kyiv, in and out of Old Lake, in and out of New Lake, into cemented channels, where it becomes an artificial waterway, then into the pine forest near the DWRF district. Here, it dives head first into Bull Swamp, where there was something to do with bulls, a.k.a. Little Birch Lake, where the wagon-repair workers’ boys used to swim, a.k.a. Rainbow Lake, where in 2015 a certain Slavik, for 30 minutes, before dawn, struck the ice with a socket wrench, and the sound echoed through the forest. Slavik asks you to imagine this: a winter, a forest, a frozen lake, it's raining, it's pitch black. A large German shepherd arrives on the scene. She comes quietly and sits on the bank, watching, not barking, just watching. A wild duck quacks from the lake's far end. Slavik has made a meter-wide hole. Slavik goes in the hole. 

<p> <i>What bliss, to dive fully, head and all, and, coming up again, to feel how an icy porridge slips down the head and the body, how a glorious burning heat pours into the body's nooks. Indescribable! Silence. Not a single living soul, not a single sound, just the rustle of the rain and the sound from the little chunks of ice rubbing against one another in the icy porridge of my ice hole! No desire to get dressed! The soul has unfolded and is striving somewhere, upwards, upwards… The drizzling rain became completely different – affectionate, dear, and kind... It seemed the life-giving energy overfilled each cell of my body!</i>

<p> When Plyakhoviy reemerges, it is once more the river Darnitsya. Seeping over thick mats of peat (which can burn for days in summer), it branches in two. The northern arm is a reclamation canal built by Stalin to drain swamps and fight malaria-carrying mosquitoes; it travels into “sleeper neighborhoods,” under their panel-block compounds and busy outdoor markets. The southern arm rushes (trickles on hot days) out of the forest to hug the Radical Chemical factory (“the Chernobyl of Kyiv”), hug the Kyiv Factory of Chemical Fibers, hug the Institute of Organic Chemistry, hug Cement Heaven, hug Steel Symphony, hug a very large refrigerated-truck transportation company, hug the #4 Darnitsya Heat and Power Plant (Kyiv’s oldest and most tired), and at this point, before it can find anything else to appreciate, it is caught in another reclamation canal. 

<p>The canal is mostly underground, except in some places, like under the bridge on Prague street, where the river Darnitsya comes up for air. Here, each day, the wagon-repair workers placed bets on what they’d find in the water. Back then, in the 1960s, red, purple, or orange froth were, reportedly, solid choices. 

<p>A churning yellow froth, says the son of a wagon-repair worker. And the forest turned yellow in a moment.

<p>In 1509 you’d have bet on bream, idе, barbel, zander, pike, perch, and such-like others. 

<p>This past November, water like green syrup. 

<hr/>
<p>///<hr/>
<p>The contents of the river Darnitsya
<hr/>
<p>Of course, we cannot know with certainty who put what in the water and when. Most of the surrounding factories wound down and rolled over in 1991 and the ensuing bandit years. When they still operated, the contents of the river were classified.  

<p>We do know that the workers of the Radical factory, for example, were paid three times as much as other factory workers and retired early. We know they produced chlorine, caustic soda, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, potassium chlorate, DDT, and foam rubber. 

<p><i>There’s a floor which was specifically for producing mercury. I walked on the territory in my boots, it ate away at the leather… I worked in ’86 or ’87. And now it’s closed, it’s probably not working…. And they made DDT, on floor 22. It was very unpleasant to be on the territory. 

<p>To move around on the territory… new boots were gone immediately, at once, the leather, on the bottom. So saturated, the snow, was so saturated with filth… 

<p>Convicts, only convicts worked there…
</i>
<p>We now know that, over the course of the 42 years of its operation, the factory released 700 tons of mercury into the environment, of which some portion was ingested by the river-bottom community of organisms in the river Darnitsya, accumulated, and converted into the even more toxic form of methylmercury. When, in 1996, the ecological inspection arrived to investigate the closed-down factory, they found 134 tons of mercury, 109 tons of sulfuric acid, 44 tons of mercury sludge, 62 tons of hydrochloric acid, 12 tons of ammonia, 486 tons of salt solvation, and close to 2500 tons of other waste, which was simply left to seep into the soil. 

<p>According to a member of the Green Circle citizen ecologists’ club, to the passerby, the curtain of secrecy and the sharp chemical smell emanating from the water of the river Darnitsya communicated a sense of danger that needed no devices and no analyses. 

<p>This danger inadvertently created unlikely protected zones, ad hoc nature reserves along the open portions of the river, such as the Grey Heron Swamp, which the club members discovered in 1989 as they traced it head to mouth. They were, the Green Circle member reports, astounded at the bounty and diversity of wild nature preserved in its untouchability. 

<hr/>
<p>///<hr/>
<p>Schooltime at DWRF <hr/>

<p>The pears and apples in the DWRF school orchard were off limits. Teachers knew that children carved the apples into hedgehogs with their fountain pens if given the chance.

<p>One spring, the fourth-grade teacher took everyone outside to a small plot in the orchard. The plot was maintained by Aunt Faya, who lived in a small house in that orchard with a cat and a crow. The teacher said, you must investigate something here. She took a potato, cut it into quarters, put the quarters in the ground, and said, you'll be watching how this grows. The children had seen potatoes grow, and everybody knew nothing would come of this. 

<p>I walk through the pine forest towards the school. I pass some of the old green board fences on my way. Outside one of them, there is a bench, on which a man and a woman sit. They are with a caretaker. They tell me they are 92 and 97. They cannot hear well so it doesn’t matter what I tell them. They sing this song from 1859, separated into harmonies:
<hr/>
  <i>
<p>There is a tall mountain, and under it a grove — 
<p>a green grove, a thick grove, as if a paradise.
<p>Under the grove winds a river; it shines like glass. 
<p>Through the valley green, it runs somewhere else. 
<p>At the bank’s edge, in quietude, boats are moored. 
<p>Three willows are bowed over, as if in sorrow, 
<p>that the red summer will end.
 <hr/>
<p>The cold will come, the leaves will fall, 
<p>and the water will carry them. 
<p>I am also sorrowful over the river… 
<p>it runs, it makes noise, and my poor heart swoons and hurts. 
<p>Oh river, blue! Just like your waves, 
<p>my joys and happy days, have run away. 
<p>Spring will return to you, beloved river. 
<p>But youth will never return. It won’t return!
<hr/>
<p>There is a tall mountain, the grove buzzes. 
<p>Birds are singing loudly, and the river glistens.  
<p>How nice it is, how happy it is, to live in this wide world! 
<p>Why is it that my heart swoons and hurts! 
<p>It hurts with worry, that the spring will return. 
<hr/>
<p> But youth will… not return. It won’t return. 
 <hr/>
</i>
<p>///<hr/>
<p>Weather in DWRF<hr/>
<i><p>It is necessary to note that none our observations are real — they are calculated based on archival weather. Moreover we do not guarantee that these specific plants grew and bloomed in Kyiv in these years. It is known that not all of the plants noted in the “Blooming Monitor” are native representatives of Kyivan flora; some were purposefully introduced or accidentally arrived very recently. The dates given are hypothetical — “when would this plant bloom if it lived in Kyiv during this year?” The ability of plants to predict the weather is not recognized — they may only know about the past, not about the future. Temperatures close to zero do not speed up nor delay the arrival of the event. It is thought that life processes simply freeze in the current position. 

<p>Such observations as “the hackberry blooms, expect a frost” and “leaves on an oak before an ash bode a dry year” are discarded. A few days after a thaw, there may (or may not) be a cold spell, and in this regard, there is nothing special about the hackberry.

<h1>It was a week since children's camp had ended...</h1>
<p class="permalink"><a href="#2019-06-23-01">June 23rd, 2019</a></p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/59975207-1fb82f00-95be-11e9-83fa-a83543b75193.jpeg" width="600" />
<p>It was a week since children's camp had ended and I got up earlier than usual to try and recapture something that now seemed gone.</p>
<p>I belonged to my job again, though what kind of work could it be with a head crawling with snakeflies, glided over softly by water striders, bitten by the occasional red wood ant, and then stuffed with hygroscopic wool...</p>
<hr />
<p>Through hot wafts of lavender, and flutters of orange butterflies, our botanist leads us towards a piece of dragonfruit he's cut up under a larch, which, when it's dry, you can't even nail a nail into. The creamlike dragonfruit is, by the way, a cactus just like those on the ground in bloom nearby. We crowd around. We're traveling through time, it tastes sour and sweet, we're in Asia, we're in our native steppes, we're in South America. Do girls need dates? 
<p>Everyone leaves and now we trace the steps of last year's botanical quest, making sure the girl Cossack is still under the awning, proclaiming that times are not what they used to be (she is, that much has stayed the same); that the bird feeder is still in the lilac bush, just above where the mouse had dug its burrow (it is, but the burrow's caved in); that there still are no benches to sit on under the heart-shaped leaves of the Manchurian pipevine (there's one now, but we don't sit on it).</p>
<p>A series of social nuances dictates we must enjoy a refreshing drink outside of the botanical garden. Out in the melting asphalt I feel stripped of purpose and will and anything I had been riding on, and start to melt too, in a dissociative way. We're at Domino's, he has to leave, I feel sick. I chug a carton of tomato juice I don't really want. He says his old research advisor made turf for playing fields for money; his method uses fewer seeds and more management. Back in the garden, hundreds of larvae of the American fall webworm moth are chewing on pear leaves, inside giant laced palaces.</p>
<hr />
<p> In the following brief interlude, a ginkgo leaf, a magnolia pod, and three papery bladernut capsules explode inside a silk lilac bag. 
<hr />
<p><a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/9nFcrswN4uoj6HrT6">Среди пафосных спинок и туй в горшках томятся реликты в лавандовом шелковом мешочке.</a> Их периодически орошает прохладным туманом который пшикает на стол &quot;под гранит&quot; из специальных пимпочек под зонтом.</p>
<p>Вот листик, это гинкго, который в ранней жизни учился вонять плодами как рвотой, чтобы путешествовать сквозь динозавров, а потом сквозь сотни миллионов лет. Он рождался опять и опять, медленно, и консервативно, чтобы дожить до этого дня.</p>
<p>Вот ветка магнолии, живущей, когда-то, в голой тишине, без убаюкивающего жужжания еще неродивщихся пчел, прерванной только скрежетом лапок жуков которые её опыляли.</p>
<p>Вот клекачка перистая. Три фонарика на веточке, надутые коробочки, несут по три блестящих семечка. Куда?</p>
<p>Куда! На выставку, про реликты, в Малу Галерею Мистецького Арсенала!<br/>Открытие в 6:30. Вы -- дары. Могли бы быть розою.</p>
<p><em>Внутри шелкового мешочка лист гинкго, каменный плод-шишка магнолии, и коробочки клекачки осознают всю тавтологию конца своего и тихо взрываются, превращаясь в пепел.</em></p>
<hr />
<p> [CODA]
<p>On the first day of camp, my hair was an electric blue. Children ran their hands across it, painting their palms.
<p>On the second day, Oleksiy gave me a granite feathergrass seed.
<p>On the third day, Alicia made a wooden axe to kill her love. 
<p>On the fourth day, Vlad handed me a tiny piece of green paper, and said "you need this". 
<p>On the fifth day, Tatyana said there was snow on the roof.
<p>On the sixth day, we got up at sunrise, and slept in a field of invasive fleabane. 
<p>On the seventh day of camp, we all cried, but I couldn't.

<h1>On Moving Out, (Feat. a Duet with Ursula K. Le Guin)</h1>
<p class="permalink"><a href="#2019-05-21-01">May 21st, 2019</a></p>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/59974837-3dcf6080-95b9-11e9-8fc2-43f6cb38bd3a.jpg" width="600" />
<p>In a small town, the closets are full of skeletons, letters, and rotting yellow dresses. There is a woman who can still smell cookies from 1946.</p>
<p>In a city, closets are emptied by the first of the month, and the streets don't remember their names.</p>
<hr />
<p>The horse chestnut is the official tree of Kyiv, it lines the streets. During the past two world wars, horse chestnuts were harvested (sometimes by girl- and boy-scouts in mass rallies) for starch, digested by the bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum into acetone (we call it by the things it gives us), and used to make the explosive cordite.</p>
<hr />
<p>We are using too many exclamation marks in our short, rare messages to one another. People shout when there's distance.</p>
<hr />
<p>In our city nobody knows where to go--every day the streets are called something different. &quot;It's impossible,&quot; says my blind grandmother. &quot;And one doesn't get used to it. Just the other day, a stranger kissed me all over my face, for showing him the way.&quot;</p>
<hr />
<p>A Duet with Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
<p>A house is safe but nothing more, as I had once believed. There’s nothing I want to keep in it, that is all outside the house. The house is safe, though, and I am grateful to it.</p>
<p>“A leaf a gourd a shell a net a bag a sling a sack a bottle a pot a box a container. A holder. a recipient.”</p>

<p>This morning near the dumpsters some things were kind of white. White was the confetti of peach blossom petals on the pavement. Against them pigeons were picking at long pieces of pizza. Patches of fur on the Japanese cat--we call her that because she has two black dots on her head near her ears--where a used, matty kind of white, and so was the hair of the old woman trawling through the dumpster.</p>

<p>“If it is a human thing to do, to put something you want, because it is useful, edible, or beautiful, into a bag, or a basket, or a bit of rolled bark or leaf, or a net woven of your own hair, or what have you, and then take it home with you, home being another, larger kind of pouch or bag, a container for people, and then later on you take it out and eat it or share it or store it up for winter in a solider container or put it in the medicine bundle or the shrine or the museum the holy place the area that contains what is sacred, and then the next day you probably do much the same again--if to do that is human if that's what it takes, then I am a human being after all. Fully, freely, gladly, for the first time.”</p>

<p>Anna moved to Kharkiv. She makes clothes that wrap around people's special bodies. In June we will be in Lishnya together with 33 children. Until then, I ask her to sew 33 small cloth bags.</p>

<h1>The Mulberry Boys of the Palace Garden</h1>
<p class="permalink"><a href="#2019-02-26-01">February 26th, 2019</a></p>

<p>I’ll start this post heavy. I’m currently living in a country where manifestations of violence abound. And I’m not talking about the onslaught of far-right violence against minority groups. On an almost daily basis, I witness normalized physical and verbal abuse between parents and their children. Drunk parents who hurl screaming insults at their children. Sober parents who hurl screaming insults at their children. Parents who hurl screaming insults at each other in front of their children, fight, throw things, slam doors. 
<p>My day job is in children’s education; I’ve done extensive volunteering with kids; I come from a broken home myself. Children’s rights and rearing practices have always been a topic to think about and to talk about. But since moving to Ukraine, they’ve also been a painful and yawning gap--for the overwhelming majority there are no rights or practices to speak of. And many would deny that childhood trauma has been taking place en masse, and still is--it’s blended into the fabric so well, that even the ways in which the adults themselves have been victims of violence is sublimated and obscured. 
<p>There’s nothing this exposé accomplishes; it’s another missive I’m sending into that empty space. But it seemed appropriate to start with, before explaining why a document from 1835 (holding 19, document list 1, document 765) caught my eye with the title “Petition by wardens of public charity and pupils of gardening at the Kiev Palace Garden, Grigoryev and Tukalskiy, regarding their inclusion in the common or state peasant class.” 
<p>Vasiliy Ivanov Tukalskiy, 26, and Lazar’ Pavlov Grigoryev, 21, were orphans. Both had been abandoned in infancy because they were born out of wedlock, and had spent their earliest years living with two different men in rural Ukraine--peasants, who were paid to keep them until they were of age to work. In the 19th century, that age came sooner rather than later.

<i>Mulberry street today</i>
<p>In 1825, the head gardener at the Kiev Palace Garden (the remnants of which are now called <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/NZBhP8RigW92">Mariinsky park</a>) requests that two boys be brought on to help with gardening tasks. Vasiliy is 16; Lazar’ is 11. The tasks of their labor are many and varied. There are horses to tend to, earth to move, roots to dig up, trees to plant, fences to erect, and instruments to fix. Firewood must be chopped, rubble carted, greenhouse windows installed, and compost turned. There are orchards, plant nurseries, vineyards, and a mulberry plantation. The mulberry plantation is fattening droves of silkworms. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/292p15XCXq12">Located on the current site</a> of the Oleksandrovsk hospital, on what has ever since been Mulberry street, it even hosts a mulberry school, in which mulberry specialists are taught the art of boiling the silkworm cocoons in copper cauldrons and unwinding them on silk-spinning machines. The silk and the silk specialists are in high demand across the Russian Empire. 
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/53442732-9d09d380-3a12-11e9-89fc-c3b706336a9e.jpg" alt="Silkworm Moth" width="600" />
<i>The silkworm moth</i>
<p>Ten years pass. Vasiliy and Lazar’ are still at the Garden. They have been specially trained to tend the grapevines Peter I imported from the Rhine. Living as child serfs, they’re bound to the land and to their duties, and will be serfs, for as long as their debt of illegitimate birth is outstanding. How long is that? 
<p>Views are split. According to the law and their petition, they should be released from their labors upon reaching adulthood, and written into one of the two lowest classes available: the urban commoners or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_serf">state peasants</a> (for more on social hierarchy, or <i>sosloviya</i>, in the Russian Empire, go <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_estates_in_the_Russian_Empire">here</a>). But the new head gardener Kamenskiy quickly follows up their petition to the local government with a small letter of his own: 
<p><i>The boys, by the way, are still very much needed here. </i>
<p>They aren’t let go. According to a new rule, which the municipal government alone seems to be privy to, they are to work for another decade upon reaching adulthood. Even then, they’re strongly advised to stay on, given that they have learned but one trade, are “useless for anything else” and are needed at the Garden.
<p>The boys rebel, leaving the property “without taking proper leave” at night, and Kamenskiy is quick to file this transgression with the local authorities. Then, silence. After a few months the authorities are curious--how are the boys? Are they still rebelling? And... have they married? 
<p><i>The boys are giving me no trouble. They are very well-behaved, and single,</i> replies Kamenskiy. The record fades.

<p>I’ve placed some items from the mulberry garden inventory in the visual list at the end of this entry. The asset list is part of a different set of documents from 1835, which detail the destruction of the mulberry garden. That year, Kyiv’s military governor strongly “suggested” that the Building Committee remove the mulberry trees and the grapevines, to make way for roads, and buildings, and for more reinforcements of the hill to protect the esplanade below. An <a href="http://semiletov.org/trudy/kievmap1846.html"> incredibly detailed map</a> of Kyiv from 1852 shows the mulberry garden long gone, the governor having set up his office in its place (16). Other notable locations are the Palace Garden (23), “Countess Levasheva’s Boarding House for Poor Ladies” (the governor’s wife) (21), and the “Artificial Mineral Waters” establishment (14).

<h1>The Wasp and the Caterpillar, or How to Work with the National City Archives of Kyiv</h1>
<p class="permalink"><a href="#2019-02-14-01">February 14th, 2019</a></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/52786637-1218f880-3064-11e9-85ce-c560b6e3383d.gif" alt="The Wasp and the Caterpillar" width="600" /></p>
<p> The Wasp and the Caterpillar  is a tentative title for a virtual experience I have been working on, exploring possession and control, and also biohacking, and unnatural nature, and all that usual stuff (if you&rsquo;re on a computer, here's <a href="https://vasilivna.github.io/Build_4/index.html">a different work</a> with similar themes). It was triggered by my fascination with reports of parasitic wasps zombifying spiders to <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/218/15/2326">weave them custom cocoons</a>, and especially with their manipulation of their hosts&rsquo; DNA, leading me to have the fun thought that <a href="https://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2009/03/30000-parasitoids-cant-be-wrong.html">wasps are the original biohackers</a>.</p>
<p>When I started to think in the direction of narrative, personal history, and archival documents, I wanted the work to take a turn. The first thing that came to mind is my own experience with possession and control. While the option doesn&rsquo;t disgust me, I think I may have stumbled upon the perfect narrative yesterday, while at the National City Archives of Kyiv. I&rsquo;ll be previewing that story in the next post; meanwhile, here&rsquo;s a little bit about working with archives in Ukraine, in case you&rsquo;ve never done that before.<br /></p>
<p>To gain access to archives in Kyiv, I first had to determine which of the <a href="http://kiev.moygorod.ua/ru/archives/?page=all">many</a> archives I wanted to work with. Seeing as I&rsquo;m specifically interested in urban nature, I&rsquo;ve started with the city archives, which hold lots of historical documents generated by various local formations: local governments, local groups, local universities, etc. They also have documents belonging to groups which, at one time or another, made urban forestry decisions in this city. This is essentially what I am after on my quest to find out about the people and desires responsible for this city&rsquo;s &ldquo;second&rdquo; nature (to use William Cronon's usage of Hegel's term, meaning human-constructed). <br /><br />I contacted them using an online form, which required me to state the subject of my request, the time period of interest, give my address, and paste my signature. After this, I naturally assumed that sweet archive angels would descend upon me with hundreds, perhaps thousands of photocopied pages of pertinent information, and maybe even deliver them to my mailbox (!) seeing as they wanted to know where I live, and seeing as I&rsquo;ve been a big baby about venturing into the cold this winter and this would have been very convenient. I received no reply. When I followed up, I got this cryptic e-mail:</p>
<p>вх.№068/Б-1863 від 28.12.2018.<br />(044)440-63-50<br /><br />They couldn&rsquo;t establish my identity when I called, but then a woman rang back to say &ldquo;but  of course , you have been invited to the  reading room !&rdquo;, as though it was inconceivable that I had not understood that from the email.</p>
<p>The reading room is open Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, from 10 to 1 and from 2 to 5:45. If you have a 9 to 5, sorry. The keeper of the keys is a rather reserved elderly lady, who sits behind a desk, behind a security guard, within a glass-walled room, so as to better observe the Ukrainian public as it thumbs through one-of-a-kind pieces of paper. The lady turns out to be helpful, if only you&rsquo;re respectful and if you don&rsquo;t betray that you don&rsquo;t know what the fuck you&rsquo;re doing (I&rsquo;ve observed mild wrath when circumstances are otherwise). But, of course, there were no photocopies of pertinent documents waiting for me (ha!). What was actually waiting for me was:</p>
<p>First, a brief interview, during which I noticed she was expecting some qualifying enunciations/incantations from me, and, feeling instinctively that being an artist and looking for cool stories wouldn&rsquo;t get me in, I became a graduate student researcher at Rice University, writing a monograph on the history of park culture in Kyiv (I&rsquo;m not, and I&rsquo;m not). Technically, the archives are openly accessible to any member of the public, and people come here for various reasons--at least half seem to be looking to settle property or inheritance rights in court. But, in my opinion, if you&rsquo;d like carte blanche for using the facility, you&rsquo;re best off declaring you&rsquo;re a student or a writer with a broad topic of interest. <br /><br />Two photographs, a photocopy of my passport, and a statement of purpose later, I was the lucky beholder of a National City Archives of Kyiv membership card.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/52784685-92d4f600-305e-11e9-9245-35e5a5611a7c.jpg" alt="Membership card" width="600" /></p>
<i> Plastic sleeve belongs to the artist. </i>  <br /> <br />On my subsequent visit, I was admitted to the reading room. If like me you&rsquo;re in this room because you&rsquo;re weirdly bent on plants, you&rsquo;ll be pleasantly distracted, because just like the Vernadsky Library (which I&rsquo;ll write about at some point), and seemingly any other post-soviet bureaucratic space, the place is a veritable jungle filled with snake plants (or &ldquo;mother-in-law&rsquo;s tongues&rdquo; as they&rsquo;re known here), spider plants, succulents, and cacti, of all sorts and dimensions.
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/52784682-92d4f600-305e-11e9-8b86-ac0162ff5c99.png" alt="Reading Room" width="600" /></p>
<i>The Reading Room at the National City Archives of Kyiv (currently with more plants).</i>  <br /><br />Here&rsquo;s the room--one I almost died in on my first visit (had I not been very hot from the interpellative first meeting with the lady and from the anticipation of digging through old papers, I would have been very cold, as there was no heating, and the temperature outside was a solid -10&deg;C). Layers and a thermos have since been good companions. 
Below, I&rsquo;ve tried to sketch out the general process I&rsquo;ve been going through to acquire a document.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/52787811-ba7c8c00-3067-11e9-8007-87c309750161.jpg" alt="Archive process" width="600"/></p>
<p>The first step towards gripping the coveted archival text is to select a book describing the holdings for a specific period (pre-soviet, soviet, or post-soviet). I've started with the oldest records, working forwards. The book presents you with broad categories into which the holdings are grouped (e.g. health, education, labor unions), which are split into organizations (e.g. the pigeon-breeders&rsquo; club of Kyiv, which is real). Next, I fill out a form to request a list of that organization&rsquo;s documents, and submit. Two days later, I return to what at times is a massive 5000-page book, or a smaller, 1000-page book, and if I&rsquo;ve been greedy and ordered many document lists at once, I have several of these babies. The job now is to pour over the descriptions of each document described within (about ten descriptions per page, you do the math).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking through various municipal documents, because prior to the establishment of any official urban forestry group (the first being the &ldquo;Garden Committee&rdquo; in 1887), any questions of plants and gardens were dealt with by the general municipal assembly. This basically means that documents concerning plants and gardens are sprinkled sparsely throughout a gargantuan list of everything the local government discussed within an approximately 50-year period (I'm actually relieved that not every decade is accounted for). The task is to literally spot the &ldquo;tree&rdquo; in a forest of documents that all sound like &ldquo;Concerning the business of Madame Grigoryeva's application regarding the land directly adjacent to her lot to the west, and the possibility of establishing a road through it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Right now, it takes me an average of three days to look through one list of documents. As I do so, I'm trying to stay lively, going for speed but also clever triage. When I notice documents that sound interesting, I try to see them in perspective against the general corpus of things I've already selected (otherwise, you can find yourself stuck with thousands of pages of one type of land use debate the next time you come around, wondering why you did this to yourself and whether it's a kink). A very interesting list could mean three such forms, and thus 30 documents: <br />
<p> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/52784680-92d4f600-305e-11e9-94a0-349bb86210ee.jpg" alt="Form" width="600" /></p> 
<i>One type of form you&rsquo;ll be filling out.  </i><br /><br />Note the final column, where I&rsquo;m stating the number of pages each document has--another dangerous moment for the greedy. The greedy is me, by the way. I submit this form to the lady, and four days later, the prize is all mine! And there is absolutely no one to blame if it looks like the picture below. </p>
<p> <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/52784687-92d4f600-305e-11e9-96ea-ddbf3342e999.jpg" alt="Archival Document" width="600" />
<i> Pre-1917 documents often suffer from water damage and always from handwriting! </p> </i>
<p>Actually, much of the time, I can't understand what I'm reading, either because the handwriting is very special, or because parts are missing or crossed out. When I do get in the groove and make progress on understanding a document, it often turns out that it's rather boring in its specifics, while the more general historical information it offers I already know. In any case, once I've made a reasonable attempt to decipher the writing within (and maybe took some notes), I fill out a form detailing the kind of work I've used the document for, and another form if I'd like to take any pictures (add four days for approval on that). Then I take 1-2 ibuprofen. And I'm done! I've read an archival document!</p>
<p>Anyways, though I&rsquo;ve clearly been shedding light on the painstaking realities of working with archives, the process has in fact been meditative, and instructive, and I&rsquo;ve pretty much stopped worrying and learned to love the form, and to love the elderly lady, who sometimes yells at me from behind the glass because she thinks I&rsquo;m photographing things on my phone, which I sometimes am. And, as I mentioned, gems have been uncovered. Or at least I think they&rsquo;re gems. Or maybe I&rsquo;m suffering from Stockholm syndrome, and this is the true way in which working with the National City Archives of Kyiv is weaving itself into the themes of possession and control in my work. And perhaps, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.livescience.com/51764-wasp-spider-zombies.html">not long from now, the subservient arachnid will be dead, its web transformed into a shelter for the spawn of the creature that once controlled it, according to a new study</a>&rdquo;.</p>

<h1>Signals, Plants, and Labor Camps</h1>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/50574757-5ffcd880-0df7-11e9-9bec-6d950af9fbde.jpg" alt="White Sea Biological Station" width="600" /></p>
<p>Picking the next topic is existential problems and I was lost for weeks (?) and almost wrote about Georgi Markov. Almost ;).</p>
<p>I was furiously pedalling on a spin bike and going nowhere the other day when the podcast I was listening to stopped being about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osip_Mandelstam">Osip Mandelstam</a>'s death anniversary (December 27th, 1938) and started being about plants that "shouldn't be there".</p>
<p>One of RFE/RL&rsquo;s cultural digests--&ldquo;Time of Freedom&rdquo; by Andrey Sharogradsky, reported about an exhibition that <a href="http://zasushennye.ru/">recently opened at the Moscow Museum of Architecture,&ldquo;Засушенному -- верить&rdquo;</a> which I can only translate as &ldquo;What&rsquo;s dried out can be believed&rdquo;. Unfortunately, as a Ukrainian I&rsquo;m well advised to avoid travel to Russia and won&rsquo;t be able to speak to the contents of the fascinating materials presented there, but, to summarize their general nature, the exhibition traces the history of Stalinist repressions through herbariums collected at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solovki_prison_camp">Solovki prison camps</a>--some of these collected by the prisoners themselves--supplemented by archival materials (letters, official documents).</p>
<p>The wellspring of this project seems to be Moscow University botanist Vladimir Vekhov who, in the 1960s, founded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sea_Biological_Station#The_botanical_garden">a botanical garden</a> on the Kindo peninsula near Belomorsk (on the mainland near the Solovetsky Islands) and also discovered six plants that were rather out of place within the native boggy taiga vegetation--among them the wild pea <em>Lathyrus gmelinii, </em>endemic to central Asia, southern Siberia, and southern and central Ural, and the five-leaved white lupine clover <em>Lupinaster albus </em>which was known to grow in northern Asia and North America, and was never previously found in northern Europe.</p>
<p>Introduced plants are nothing new, but none of these species were found anywhere near current human settlements in the region, or even railways serving them, where they would have been in the company of many other introduced plants, mostly &ldquo;weeds&rdquo;, which often arrive surreptitiously via shoe soles, airstreams, and bird droppings. Moreover, none were the type of invasive species that could even be classified as weeds (which further piques curiosity as to how and why they found a life there).</p>
<p>Upon questioning the locals, the botanists learned that in the 1930s and 40s the half-ruined barracks near the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Sea_Biological_Station">White Sea Biological Station</a> from which they were conducting their field experiments belonged to forced labor camp prisoners logging wood in the surrounding forests.</p>
<p><a href="http://zasushennye.ru/himija-i-zhizn/">Biologist D.D. Sokolov picked up the threads of this story</a> in the late nineties. When he arrived on the scene 40 years later he was not only able to find and add several new species to Vekhov&rsquo;s special group of exotics (<em>Calamagrostis obtusata</em>, <em>Stellaria holostea</em>)--he also discovered the same exotic species group near labor camp barrack ruins of the same period on a neighboring island, and determined that we could reasonably expect to find all these species growing together in a meadow in southern Ural. Sokolov's guess is that these plants were seeded from hay, prepared in the East and shipped to the area during the period of Stalinist repressions.</p>
<p>Weeds and &ldquo;alien&rdquo; plants are fucking awesome and were my gateway drug to the present obsession with ecological underdogs (trash monsters, bed bugs, flies, pigeons) and their lifeways. I've jokingly thought of myself as a spoiled disciple of Timothy Morton's <em>Dark Ecology/Ecology without Nature</em>... Since that's what I'll be having but with all the nature. Anyways.</p>
<p>In actuality I was the disciple/child, of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengiz_Gudava">Tengis Gudava</a>--a repressed Soviet dissident, who spent 5 years in labor camps in Perm, and would have spent more but was pardoned. As one might not imagine, a life with the remnants of someone who was broken and tortured in labor camps is a special sort of not nice, though those remains did do some fun stuff in the meantime like write a <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/2302908/">fiction novel about an intersex angel in a gulag</a> that is apparently popular with the gay community and a <a href="https://www.netslova.ru/gudava/sumer/">really intense manuscript about Sumerians and the Bible</a> that isn't popular with anyone.</p>
<p>I've read none of it, not least of all because reading my stepfather's work is not just personally unpleasant but often deals with intense trauma as its subject and not with weeds or pigeons. Sometimes I&rsquo;ll think about how I could cut, reframe, repurpose, and appropriate some of the things he wrote so that maybe something new comes out of the pieces. Like how the <em>Myennis octopunctata</em> fly came to be on the pieces of maple KyivZelenBud left behind.</p>
<p>
<p>Meanwhile, I've been working on a sound album, featuring one fabulous Ukrainian lady (identity to be revealed), to bring to life the generated KyivZelenBud poems I gave a peek of in my first post. Ultimately I am aiming for an album of field recordings, minimally manipulated, highlighting all the participants of the mistletoe-Myennis chain. Playing around with those sounds during the short days and long nights of this endless gray winter, here's something noisier I inadvertently created, as one is wont to do when trying to make something nice. <br /><br /></p>

<h1>Urban Ecology Chains Are Magic</h1>

<p class="permalink"><a href="#2018-12-15-01">December 15, 2018</a></p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22150913/50042669-c1d6e780-006e-11e9-81db-5dd9d912d662.png" alt="KZB_chain" width="600" height="550" /></p>
<p>Reasonable panic has been brewing in Kyiv--maples, poplars, oaks, and other popular urban tree varieties are being indiscriminately mauled by the city&rsquo;s municipal landscaping organization &ldquo;<a href="http://kievzelenbud.com">KyivZelenBud</a>&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ll leave that story alone, as I trust it&rsquo;s receiving its share of attention, and instead tell another--a multispecies muddle (to use Donna Haraway&rsquo;s phrase)--one that&rsquo;ll fit some birds, a shrub, a tree, a KyivZelenBud (KZB) worker&rsquo;s chainsaw, and a fly (among other insects). Just in time for the holidays, here&rsquo;s the magical-but-very-real urban ecology story you&rsquo;ve been waiting for!</p>
<p><br />As its name suggests, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistle_thrush">mistle thrush</a> likes mistletoe, and its sticky berries, though they contain a toxin called viscumin, which gives it the shits. This, for the mistletoe, is the entire point, as, relieving itself while still &ldquo;at the table&rdquo;, so to speak, the thrush &ldquo;plants&rdquo; the seed pod onto a nearby branch to spread.</p>
<p>We, the citizens, hate mistletoe. Long gone are the days when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual_of_oak_and_mistletoe">we donned white gowns to cut it with a ritual golden sickle</a> and stirred it into magical elixirs. The mistletoe is a parasite. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscum_album">evergreen hemiparasite</a>, which can produce almost all its food on its own, even in the winter, feeding birds and insects while its host stands bare... but a parasite nonetheless! An opportunist.</p>
<p>And so, according to KZB protocol, city trees must be free of mistletoe.</p>
<p>Years ago, when a maple tree on <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/maUfaGZJpv72">1/6 Zakhidna street</a> was pruned by KZB workers to remove its mistletoe, the wounds invited some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomes_fomentarius"><em>Fomes fomentarius</em></a> spores inside. First a parasite, then a decomposer, <em>Fomes</em> is a harbinger of death, finding weak trees and making them weaker, for decades sometimes, until their insides are rotten and ready to take on new, simpler forms (amino acids, compost).</p>
<p>I could end the story there, but here&rsquo;s how this one keeps going.</p>
<p>During the spring and fall, <em>Fomes fomentarius</em> (the tinder conk, the hoof fungus, the blood sponge, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96tzi">Iceman&rsquo;s mushroom</a>) releases 887 million spores per second. The spores are so small, they look like smoke.</p>
<p><br />On the night of August 8th, I was taking a walk past the maple on 1/6 Zakhidna street, and <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D5ef8b1EG27KBKJC8">under the lamplight it seemed the mushrooms were burning. I looked closer, and found a squirming, thriving, vibrant insect community</a>!</p>
<p>The colonies changed in composition--crawling worms and moths at night, <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1D23tTNb9APt7iqoLLJuhes4_44ig2bVf?usp=sharing">orange, red, and brown flies in the daytime</a>, all insects I couldn&rsquo;t identify. Among them was... another insect I couldn&rsquo;t identify, but which to me was markedly different from the rest--<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bc2Z_kGrPDorDAkD223Tk1Qt3BQliS_6">a beautiful, tiny, shiny, zebra-striped fly</a>.</p>
<p>The insect community was elating enough in itself, but the fly became an obsession.</p>
<p>At first I entertained the wild notion that the Australian <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/jean_hort/5750004212/"><em>Lenophila nila </em></a>had migrated to Ukraine, but my conscience wouldn&rsquo;t let me enjoy this outlandish LIE. Three months later, with Medvedev&rsquo;s <em>Keys to the Insects of the European Part of the USSR</em>, and hundreds of diptera.info pages behind me, I made a definitive classification -- <a href="http://ukrbin.com/index.php?id=55824"><em>Myennis octopunctata</em></a>, a picture-wing fly! As flies eat both mushrooms and nectar, I am still unsure about what attracted them to the mushroom--the fungus itself, or the syrup that was oozing out of its top.</p>
<p>Cathartic identifications aside (and believe me this is not the last you&rsquo;ll hear about flies from me)--how humbling! This unexpected, promiscuous, and unruly intrusion. These cavorting fungi and birds and flies and beetles, all continuing on, when we&rsquo;d rather be solemn, and mourn our thwarted desires for maples! To join in the merriment, I&rsquo;d like to naively celebrate KyivZelenBud as the poetic agent of this holiday story, with a few, robot-crafted poems--sourced from the posts on their website, and fed through a Markov chain.<br /><br /></p>

<p>Thank you for your attention if you made it all the way here! As Anna Tsing put it, &ldquo;if a rush of troubled stories is the best way to tell contaminated diversity, then it&rsquo;s time to make that rush part of our knowledge practices&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m still learning about all the actors in this story, and I think there&rsquo;s lots more to come.

<p>Happy Holidays!</p>
