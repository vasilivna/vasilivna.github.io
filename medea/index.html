            <p> This map contains two layered sets of open data: the geolocations of fires recorded on the Kinburn Peninsula since the beginning of the full-scale invasion and the geolocations of observations of flora and fauna made by users of the iNaturalist app in the same area. Fire data was acquired through remote sensing and provided by the "Sviatoslav's Biloberezhzhia" National Park Research Department. </p>
