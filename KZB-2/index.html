<p>This spoken word/field recording album came about through a sequence of events that culminated in early 2019. </p>
<p>A thrush ate a mistletoe berry and shat out the seed onto a branch of a Norway maple on 1/6 Zakhidna street. The resulting mistletoe growth alarmed the municipal forestry group KyivZelenBud, who dispatched workers to remove it and its host branch. Soon after, spores of a tinder conk mushroom were flying past. They settled into the open wound, growing a network of mycelium throughout the tree. When fruiting bodies emerged, they were discovered by the mushroom-eating picture wing fly, <i>Myennis octopunctata</i>. The picture wing fly was discovered by Lisa Biletska, who collected KyivZelenBud’s online posts, and fed them through a Markov chain. A municipal nature poetry was born. Nadia Parfan read the poetry. It is translated below. </p>

<p>The voice in these poems is radically indeterminate, multiplicitous, split across nodes of desire. Stretched in between is a common language (/parlance) that evokes and inverses the genres of nature writing, promotional copywriting, and the autobiographical Facebook post.</p>
<p>
Several “anxieties” are revealed: <br><br>
the natural/unnatural binary<br>
the commercial modernization of green spaces<br>
the decorative turn in Ukrainian landscaping<br>
the national moment in current Ukrainian history<br>

<p>Interspersed, are field recordings from the Vidradniy neighborhood of Kyiv, Ukraine.</p>
