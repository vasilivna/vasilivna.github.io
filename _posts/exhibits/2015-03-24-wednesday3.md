## Thank you ##

If you have gone through all/most of the documentation on this site and reached here, thank you.
<br><br>
After Wednesday I was essentially done with this project, with only a few loose ends and research to complete.
<br><br>
A 174 page shared index PDF has been created using photographs I took during this project. If you would like a copy for free email me at _<a href="mailto:hi@tomhackshaw.com">hi@tomhackshaw.com</a>_
<br><br>
<br><br>
Thanks to all the people who helped with this project. Thanks to Joseph Durana, Louis Betana, Carmela Nepomuceno, Kaoru Kodama, p. mule, John Hodgson, Albert Ashton, Taipari Connelly, my family, and anyone else I've forgotten for all of your help and support during this project.
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<br><br>
Until the next project
<br><br>
<br><br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Tom Hackshaw.
