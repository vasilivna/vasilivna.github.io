## Thursday workshop

I drove my mother to the airport early this morning, and found the cues of people and dividing fences very interesting.
<br><br>
It was a tool that allowed crowd control with just the way in which it was arranged. How it had been placed influenced the way in which people nearby interacted with it (in this case lining up in a cue).
<br><br>
I wanted to make something similar in the workshop, and see the result of this within an arts context.
